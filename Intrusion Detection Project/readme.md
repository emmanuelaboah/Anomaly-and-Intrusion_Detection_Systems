## Objectives

This project aims to applymachine learning techniques for detecting attacks/intrusions. 
More specifically, the objectives are:
```
1. Machine learning can be achieved from historical data (experience)
2. Machine learning algorithms can be applied to computer security
3. Understanding the learning task of trying to detect attacks 
4. Understanding a decision-tree learning algorithm 
5. Better understanding of search and knowledge representation 
6. Evaluation of machine learning algorithms

```
