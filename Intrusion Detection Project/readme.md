## Overview

As computers and the Internet become ubiquitous in our everyday lives, malicious activities in the cyberspace have increased significantly.  
Intrusion detection is an area of computer security that focuses  on  detecting  these  attacks  reliably.  
Intrusion  detection  systems  (IDS)  usually  have  a knowledge  base  containing  rules  that  characterize  attacks.  

Building  such a knowledge  base manually can be time consuming. However, machine learning can help build such a knowledge base  in  a  more  efficient  manner. 

In  order  to  detect  attacks,  we  need  to  differentiate  between instances  of  normal  and  attack  behavior.  
Based  on  previous  instances  of  normal  and  attack behavior, a machine learning algorithm can gain the knowledge on how to differentiate between the  two  types  of  behavior  and  represent  the knowledge  in  a  form  than  can  be  used  to  predict  if current instances are malicious or normal.

## Objectives

This project aims to apply machine learning techniques for detecting attacks/intrusions. 
More specifically, the objectives are:
```
1. Machine learning can be achieved from historical data (experience)
2. Machine learning algorithms can be applied to computer security
3. Understanding the learning task of trying to detect attacks 
4. Understanding a decision-tree learning algorithm 
5. Better understanding of search and knowledge representation 
6. Evaluation of machine learning algorithms

```

## Software Execution

In order to execute the decision tree algorithm, follow the instructions below:
```
• Please make sure the project.py is in the same directory as the KDD dataset.
• On Linux/Unix environment, locate ('cd' to) the directory of the folder containing the project.py and the dataset.
• Run the following command on the terminal:

          $ python project.py
          
The output tree, training and prediction accuracies will be printed out as shown below:
